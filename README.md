# Connect Four: Refactoring to Object-Oriented Design

## Task Overview

In this exercise, you will refactor a non-object-oriented implementation of the Connect Four game into a more feature-rich, object-oriented (OO) version. The goal is to encapsulate game logic, state, and UI interactions within classes to improve code organization, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Objectives

- Identify procedural code and refactor it into appropriate classes.
- Implement game features using OO principles (encapsulation, abstraction).
- Ensure the refactored game remains fully functional and user-friendly.

## Getting Started

1. Review the existing procedural code in `connect4.js`.
2. Plan your class structure (e.g., `Game`, `Player`, `Board`).
3. Refactor the code, moving related functions and state into classes.
4. Test the game to confirm all features work as expected.

## Requirements

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- No external dependencies required

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in your browser to play the game.
